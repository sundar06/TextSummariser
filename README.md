# TextSummariser
A Text Summation tool built with Seq2Seq model.
To understand the code better I recommend you to visit https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-data-products-that-are-magical-using-sequence-to-sequence-models-703f86a231f8.
Mr. Hamel Husain is the author of this code and I have used this to build this Text Summation tool for my personal use. I used this code and modified the some of the parameters according to the training dataset that I created on my own to train the model. 
He has wonderfully explained on how the code has been crafted and as he says... It indeed does magic! 
And about the training dataset that I created to train the model, I wont be able to share it because its sensitive. But soon I will update someother dataset that will be suitable to train the model.
